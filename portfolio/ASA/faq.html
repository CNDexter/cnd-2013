<hr>
<b>What are the benefits of joining Alpha Sigma Alpha?</b><br>
Take a look at the <a href="join.html">Join</a> page to see all the benefits that Alpha Sigma Alpha has to offer.

<br><br>
<b>Who is eligible to join?</b><br>
Any woman currently enrolled at Drexel University with a cumulative GPA of 2.5 is eligible to join.

<br><br>
<b>Will being in a sorority take up all my time?</b><br>
No it will not.<br>
Alpha Sigma Alpha has chapter meetings once a week, other events are scheduled accordingly. This leaves plenty of time for personal activities, school, and work.<br><br>

<b>Will I have to quit the clubs that I'm already in?</b><br>
No! The women of Alpha Sigma Alpha have many activities outside of the sorority and we encourage women to continue pursuing other interests, activities, and associations.

<br><br>
<b>Do I have to live in a sorority house?</b><br>
Yes. There is a one year housing requirement for all members of Alpha Sigma Alpha. Exceptions for special circumstances may be brought to the attention of the housing chair.

<br><br>
<b>Do you haze?</b><br>
No, Alpha Sigma Alpha forbids hazing. Hazing is defined as an activity which endangers the physical safety of a person; produces mental or physical discomfort; causes embarrassment, fright, humiliation, or ridicule; or degrades the individual -- whether it is intentional or unintentional.
<br><br>
Alpha Sigma Alpha members will not allow themselves or others to be subjected to any treatment which debases the individual's status or robs him or her of dignity. As hazing is both illegal and detrimental, it is the responsibility of each chapter, its members, alumnae and advisors to prevent any form of hazing.
<br><br>
The National Council will investigate any report of hazing. Confirmation of such activity will be followed by disciplinary action such as termination of memberships, chapter probation, and/or the revocation of the chapter's charter.
<br><br>
