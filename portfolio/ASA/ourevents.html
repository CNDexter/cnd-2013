<H1>Our Events</H1>
<hr>
We at Nu Nu chapter have several events throughout the year that we consider to be part of our tradition. Some of these include Bid Day, Senior Dinner, Ladybug Sleepovers, etc. Within the last year we have taken the initiative and started our Greek Calendar. We hope to continue this event well into the future and establish it as our one traditional event.<!--Within the last year we have taken the initiative and started several new and exciting events. Our Halloween Grilled Cheese fundraiser and our IFC Greek Calendar are among those. We hope to continue these well into the future and establish them as some of our traditional events.--><br><br>

<!--<H1>Grilled Cheese</H1>
<hr>
In 2006 we decided that we wanted to do something that was both fun and memorable. We do several things on and around campus but we've been lacking that 'one event' that everybody can associate with us. In 2006 we decided to change that and we've implemented our Grilled Cheese Fundraiser. In 2006 on Halloween Night when all of the houses on Greek Row are having Halloween parties we were out on our porch dressed up, chatting, and serving up hot grilled cheese sandwiches, all while having fun while and making money for Alpha Sigma Alpha.<br><br>

<H1>Greek Calendar</H1>
<hr>
The Greek Calendar is a calendar that a number of sisters put together for the then upcoming 2007 year. The calendar is not a new concept to Nu Nu as sisters from previous years have done it before. However we're trying revive that tradition and make it an annual event once again. The 2007 calendar was composed of twelve men from the IFC fraternities on campus. The 2008 calendar will feature both men and women from our fellow sororities and fraternities. We sell the calendar to the neighboring sororities and fraternities, parents, alumni, as well as to the non-affiliated Drexel community.
