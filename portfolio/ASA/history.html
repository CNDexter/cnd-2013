<H1>National History</H1>
<hr>
Alpha Sigma Alpha was founded on November 15, 1901 by five women at the Longwood University (formerly known as the state Normal School which is a school for women becoming teachers) in Farmville, Virginia, which was also the first institution of higher learning in Virginia to admit women. Within this group of students existed five intelligent and highly motivated women: Virginia Boyd Noell, Juliette Hundley Gilliam, Calva Watson Wootton, Louise Cox Carper, and Mary Williamson Hundley. These women had become the best of friends. They all rushed and had been offered bids from other sororities; however, accepting these bids would mean they would not all be sorority sisters.<br><br>

In November of 1901, the founders organized a new sorority, which was named Alpha Sigma Alpha. The charter, complete with all five of their signatures, stated: "The purpose of the association shall be to cultivate friendship among its members, and in every way to create pure and elevating sentiments, to perform such deeds and to mould such opinions as will tend to elevate and ennoble womanhood in the world."<br><br>

In March, 1922 at Drexel Institute of Technology, a group of sixteen girls mutual interests made them form what they then called Omega Delta Epsilon. Their names are as follows: Ruth Buchanan, Helen Lindenmuth, Nora Christianson, Helen Ozler, Edith Hetherington, Dorothy Bishop, Edith Diver, Anne Carter, Marjorie Bull, Harriet Lininger, Florence Garrison, Louise Johnston, Sadie Mills, Elizabeth Gifford, Ruth Brown and Hazel Thompson. After three years of hard work, Omega Delta Epsilon grew to become an influential campus organization. Unknown to the rest of the school, however, the girls secretly planned to affiliate with a national organization.<br><br>

On Memorial Day, May 25th, in 1925 eighteen new Alpha Sigma Alphas were installed and renamed the Nu Nu chapter. Installing officers were Miss Ida A. Jewett, a former National Vice President, and Miss Rosmond Root, an Alpha Beta alumnae. Florence Brierly, Nu Nu's first president, received the charter while Mildred Burdett, first chapter advisor, along with Miss Frances MacIntyre, first sponsor, watched in awe as they became initiated.
