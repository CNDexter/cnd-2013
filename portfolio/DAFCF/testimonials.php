&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"I'm writing this letter in regards to help and assistance that I received from Julie.  She was kind enough to answer my questions and concerns via email in regards to applying for Social Security Disability.  I was at a point where I thought it would be best for me to apply for assistance and Julie certainly helped me with how to go about doing that.  She has a vast amount of knowledge regarding the rules for SSDI.  She was extremely helpful to me in gathering all the information that I needed. There were times when I felt I was the biggest pest with all the emails that I sent her, but she was very friendly and very thorough in answering my questions."</i><br /><br />
