	    <h3>Services</h3>
		<b>What DAFCF can do for you:</b><br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide you with sample logs to record all of your lung infections (positive culture), nebulized medications, IV's (if applicable), ER visits and any hospitalizations.<br /><br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;We will help you write your application for disability based on the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/3.00-Respiratory-Adult.htm"><u>Social Security's Impairment listings for ADULTS with CF</u></a>  or for <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/103.00-Respiratory-Childhood.htm"><u>CHILDREN with CF</u></a>.<br /><br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide you with a sample "Activity Log" that you can use to show the SSA evaluator how much time you spend each day doing physiotherapy, nebulized medications, time spent in the bathroom (for those with digestive issues), and the amount of sleep your body requires and any thing else in your day that is affected by CF.<br /><br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that your claim is denied, we will work with you on the appeal/hearing to help you present your case in the most effective manner.<br /><br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these services are free of charge.
