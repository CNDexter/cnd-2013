&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"Thanks to Julie I was able to navigate the SSDI process without giving up or completely losing my mind.  She helped me every step of the way, from the time I was only considering applying, to the time I got approved.  Julie not only helped by sharing her knowledge about the SSDI application process, but also was always willing to lend an ear when I just needed to vent about my frustrations with the whole process!  Julie spent a ton of time and effort to help me, whether is was requesting my medical records, filling out my infection and medication logs, or answering my late-night emails.  Julie does all of this out of the goodness of her heart and asks for absolutely nothing in return.  I truly feel that without Julie's help I would not have been approved the first time I applied.  I cannot thank her enough for what she has done for me.  I don't know what I would have done without DAFCF!"</i><br /><br />
