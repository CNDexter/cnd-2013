	    <h3>Testimonials</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"I am a 36 year old woman with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) who has gotten great information and help from Julie in regards to disability and the experiences she went through with her husband Mark, who also has Cystic Fibrosis. <br /><br />

It is very common for a person to have to go out on disability if they have Cystic Fibrosis and with that comes a lot of jumping through hoops to get the disability program.  Julie offered me a bunch of insight as to how to go about it, what to gather in terms of information social security might need and what her experiences was with it for her husband Mark.  She is constantly helping so many people on the CF Forum with questions they might have about medical needs of CF people and also her experience with the disability program.<br /><br />

Her information really helped me to know what to expect when I applied for disability and she really is always a good wealth of knowledge.  The CF forum is a place where people who have CF or caregivers of people with CF can go and talk to people about an array of topics.  She has always had some great information and input to a variety of subjects on the cystic fibrosis forum."</i><br /><br />
