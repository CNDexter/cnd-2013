	    <h3>Testimonials</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The help I received from Julie Raysbrook and DAFCF was  so unbelievable.  I was denied coverage by my health insurance carrier for a visit to the emergency room and I handed the reigns over to Julie.  She is the real deal.  I thought for sure I was going to have to pay the bill, and having Julie help me in my case was just a shot in the dark for me.  But little did I know...  I guess I didn't realize who I was dealing with.  Within 6 weeks she had the insurance company wrapped around her finger and paying my claim in full.  All I had to do was sign a piece of paper appointing her as my representative on the case and that was it.  When she called me with the news that we won the case, I was blown out of the water and speechless.  I am so proud of her for what she did for me and I can only imagine the results she has produced for others.  Thank you Julie and DAFCF!  Without you people like me would just be getting pushed around by big industries like the healthcare industry.  Thanks for fighting for the little man."</i><br /><br />

Sincerely,<br />
Cory<br /><br />
