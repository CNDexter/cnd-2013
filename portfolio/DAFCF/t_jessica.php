	    <h3>Testimonials</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"In May 2005, my fiance, Richard Allen Glenn, was critically ill with cystic fibrosis and relocated from New York to North Carolina seeking a lung transplant.  Since he had changed states, he had to apply for Social Security disability again, and Julie was invaluable in helping us research what he needed to compile for his case.  She spent about two hours of her time going over the various listing impairments that the social Security Administration requires to consider him "disabled", e-mailed the documents he'd need, and provided sample log books, such as "activity logs" and "infection logs" to help him strengthen his case.<br /><br />

Richard died in November, 2005- he simply ran out of time- but although he's not here to write this letter himself, I'm sure he'd emphasize how Julie's assistance and advice saved us much time and frustration.  Thanks in large part to Julie's help, he was able to secure SSDI benefits quickly, which allowed us to focus on other important matters related to relocation and transplant.<br /><br />

Julie's considerable knowledge of cystic fibrosis, and research on everything related to the topic, have been of great help to countless CF families."</i><br /><br />

Sincerely, <br />
Jessica
